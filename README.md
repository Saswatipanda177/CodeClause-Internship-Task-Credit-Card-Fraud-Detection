# CodeClause-Internship-Task-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a Credit Card Fraud Detection System, developed as a part of the internship at CodeClause.                                   
I've utilized a comprehensive Credit Card Fraud Detection System dataset from Kaggle, delving into the intricate details of credit card transactions. Explore the dataset and gain insights that contribute to the development of an effective fraud detection solution.

Overview:                                                                                                        
Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry, requiring robust solutions for early detection and prevention. This project aims to build an effective fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms.


Key Features:                                                                                                              
➊ Dataset Analysis: Thorough exploration and analysis of the credit card transaction dataset to understand the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

➋ Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

➌ Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various machine learning models such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM for anomaly detection.

➍ Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

➎ Visualization: Visual representation of transaction class distribution, time vs. amount for legitimate and fraudulent transactions, and other relevant insights.

➏ Outlier Detection: Comparison of different outlier detection algorithms to identify the most effective approach for detecting fraudulent transactions.
